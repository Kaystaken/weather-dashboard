# weather-dashboard

## Description

### Motivation

As a user who travels often I like to plan ahead and know what weather to expect when visiting multiple cities so I can dress and pack accordingly. 

### Why?

I built this project because I wanted to make it easy for people to check the weather for multiple places and days.

### Problem Solved

You can view the weather for the next 5 days for any city. Recent searches are saved so you can view them quickly for return trips without having to type in the same city again.

### Learnings

I learned how to fetch using an API key and doing multiple fetches, I was able to use a previously learned skill and store my searches in local storage as well.

I also learned that not being repetitive in script.js makes it easier to make changes without missing stuff by using const.

I'm also getting more comfortable using images as backgrounds for styling.
